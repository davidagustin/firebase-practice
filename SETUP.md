## 🚀 **Next Steps to Deploy**

### 1. **Set up Firebase Project**
```bash
# Go to Firebase Console and create a new project
# Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
# Create Firestore database
```

### 2. **Configure Firebase**
Update `src/environments/environment.ts` with your Firebase config:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebase: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "123456789",
    appId: "your-app-id"
  }
};
```

### 3. **Set up Firestore Security Rules**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /restaurants/{restaurantId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools
